### About Me
<p>
My name is Aaron Bruce, I am an aspiring Web Developer. I went to college for Psychology and Criminal Justice. I spent a year working for a tech startup company performing investigations into e-commerce sellers. In my time there, I got involved performing database queries and I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to make my own tools. I found my passion for working with and learning about new technologies and joined AppAcademy Online to take my career and skillsets to the next level!
